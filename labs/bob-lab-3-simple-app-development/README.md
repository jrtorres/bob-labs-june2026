## Part 1: Plan the application

> ![Note]
> For simplicity, You may want to change into the directory where this lab is hosted. Tell Bob to switch into the appropriate directory. For example: `switch to the labs/bob-lab-3-simple-app-development directory`

1. **Switch to Plan Mode** and ask Bob:

    ```text
    I want to create a todo application in the todo-starter directory with a Python Flask backend and JavaScript frontend.
    Please help me plan:
    1. Project directory structure
    2. API endpoints needed
    3. Database schema
    4. Technology stack recommendations
    ```

    > **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Bob might ask you to read the existing project structure or what files are alraedy in place. In most cases, we would want to allow that so Bob has the context it needs. In this case, go ahead and only approve Bob's request to check if the `todo-starter` directory exists, and Reject Bob's other request.

    Before providing a plan, Bob will ask clarifying questions to understand your requirements better. This is a key differentiator—Bob lets you drive the process while making helpful suggestions.

    Bob might ask:
    - "How complex should the application be?"
    - "Which database would you prefer (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)?"
    - "Do you need user authentication?"
    - "Should we include additional features like categories or priorities?"

1. For this lab, respond with basic requirements (Keep in mind the exact question Bob asks you will vary):

    ```text
    - Simple/basic complexity
    - SQLite database (with SQLAlchemy)
    - No user authentication
    - Basic CRUD operations only
    - Simple front end (html, css and javascript)
    ```

    > **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Bob might ask you to read the files in the solution directory.Reject Bob's  request since we dont want to influence it with the existing solution files.

    **Expected Response from Bob:** After your clarifications, Bob should provide:

    - Directory structure with backend/ and frontend/ folders
    - REST API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - Database schema for todos (id, title, description, completed, created_at)
    - Recommendations for Flask, SQLite, CORS, etc.

1. Bob should provide a plan for the development process. Approve the request to save this plan (you can also approve Bob's request to save other planning artifacts).

1. Go ahead and open the plan (i.e. `todo-app-plan.md`) and review the different tasks for the implementation.

---

## Step 2: Backend Development

1. Switch Bob to `Code` mode and prompt it with the following:

    ```text
    Create the Flask backend for the todo app with the following files:
    1. app.py - Main Flask application with CORS enabled
    2. models.py - SQLAlchemy Todo model
    3. database.py - Database initialization
    4. requirements.txt - Python dependencies

    The Todo model should have: id, title, description, completed (boolean), created_at (timestamp)
    ```

1. Bob should generate these files in the `backend/` directory. Review each file as Bob creates them.

1. Feel free to turn on **Auto-approvals**, which will allow Bob to make multiple changes without asking for confirmation each time. To enable auto-approvals:
    1. Look for auto-approval settings in Bob
    2. Enable for this session
    3. Bob will now create multiple files rapidly

1. Implement the REST API Endpoints, prompt Bob with the following:

    ```text
    Implement the following REST API endpoints in app.py:
    - GET /api/todos - List all todos
    - POST /api/todos - Create a new todo
    - PUT /api/todos/<id> - Update a todo
    - DELETE /api/todos/<id> - Delete a todo

    Include proper error handling and JSON responses.
    ```

1. Bob should create the implementation following files in the `backend/` directory. Feel free to compare them with the files in the `solution` directory.


1. [Optional] If your implementation plan did not include any automated testing, you can manually test the backend setup using a virtual environment. Run the following commands in your terminal. 

    ```bash
    # Navigate to backend directory
    cd todo-starter/backend

    # Create virtual environment
    uv venv

    # Activate virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Run the application
    python app.py
    ```

    **Note:** Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you work on the project. You'll know it's activated when you see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

1. The server should start on port 5000. Open a webbrowser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

1. Alternatively, you can ask Bob to do that for you. **Prompt for Bob:**

    ```text
    Run the backend application and test it with 1 sample curl command per each API endpoint.
    ```

**✅ Checkpoint**: If you receive an `Ok` response, the backend is running without errors.

---

## Step 3: Frontend Development

1. Now let's create the user interface using JavaScript. Still in `Code` mode, prompt Bob with the following:

    ```text
    Create the frontend for the todo app with:
    1. index.html - Main HTML structure with a clean, modern design
    2. styles.css - Responsive CSS styling
    3. app.js - JavaScript for API interactions

    Include:
    - Input field for new todos
    - List to display todos
    - Buttons for complete and delete actions
    - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
    ```

1. Bob will go ahead and start creating the front end implementation files.

1. Lets have Bob also explain itself through comments and clear structure. **Prompt  Bob:**

    ```text
    In app.js, use literate coding to explain:
    - How the API calls work
    - How error handling is implemented
    - The purpose of each function

    Add detailed comments that would help a beginner understand the code.
    ```

1. Bob should create the implementation following files in the `frontend/` directory. Feel free to compare them with the files in the `solution` directory.

1. Test the frontend, by opening the `frontend/index.html` in your browser.

**✅ Checkpoint**: Frontend loads and displays the UI.

---

## Step 4: Testing & Verification (5 minutes)

1. Let's make sure our implementation plan is complete and test the complete application end-to-end.

1. Lets test our application. If needed, start the Backend again from the terminal.

    ```bash
    # Navigate to backend directory
    cd backend

    # Activate virtual environment (if not already activated)
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Run the application
    python app.py
    ```

1. Server should be running on `http://localhost:5000`

1. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.

1. Run the following tests:

    **Create a Todo:**
    1. Enter a title: "Learn Bob"
    2. Enter a description: "Complete all three labs"
    3. Click "Add Todo"
    4. ✅ Todo appears in the list

    **Mark as Complete:**
    1. Click the "Complete" button on a todo
    2. ✅ Todo shows as completed (strikethrough or checkmark)

    **Delete a Todo:**
    1. Click the "Delete" button on a todo
    2. ✅ Todo is removed from the list

    **Refresh Page:**
    1. Refresh the browser
    2. ✅ Todos persist (stored in database)

1. [Optional] Aside from manual testing, you can have Bob create test cases for you. **Prompt for Bob:**

        ```text
        Create unit test cases for each of the api endpoints, and ensure at least 90% code coverage.
        ```
